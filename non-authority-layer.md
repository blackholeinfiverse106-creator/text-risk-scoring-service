# Non-Authority Layer Definition

## 1. Principle of Mandatory Impotence
The Text Risk Scoring Service is designed to be **powerless** to take actions. It provides analytical signals, never executive commands. To prevent the "AI-as-Judge" failure mode, the system implements a strict non-authority signaling layer.

## 2. Signaling Mechanism
Every response generated by the system MUST pass through the `validate_output_contract` in `app/contract_enforcement.py`. This layer enforces the following:

- **is_decision: False**: Signals to the caller that the response is an observation, not a policy choice.
- **authority: 'NONE'**: Declares that the system has no legal or executive standing in the decision chain.
- **actionable: False**: Instructs the calling system that this JSON payload should not be directly piped into an execution engine (e.g., auto-ban scripts).

## 3. Misuse Prevention (Input Layer)
The system actively rejects inputs that attempt to grant it authority:
- **Forbidden Roles**: Prevents usage by entities claiming to be "admin" or "enforcer".
- **Decision Injection**: Rejects payloads containing fields like `action` or `override`, which are typical of execution pipelines.

## 4. Conclusion
By decoupling **Risk Analysis (The Signal)** from **Decision Enforcement (The Action)**, the system ensures that accountability remains with the human-controlled policy layer.
